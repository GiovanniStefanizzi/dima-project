# GrowApp
GrowApp is an application developed for the course "Design and Implementation of Mobile 
Application" of Politecnico di Milano. The app allows farmers to monitor the activities
of their crop fields, with an interface that allows one to check weatherconditions,
record activities performed, and view up-to-date satellite images.
